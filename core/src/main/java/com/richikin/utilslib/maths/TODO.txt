This package needs addressing because of the following classes...

SimpleVec2, SimpleVec2F, SimpleVec3, SimpleVec3F

Vec2, Vec2F, Vec3, Vec3F

XYSet, XYSetF

There is too much similarity between these classes. XYSet and XYSetF could, perhaps, be incorporated
into the SimpleVec classes?

Vec2, Vec2F, Vec3, Vec3F may possibly be removed, or can be parent classes of the SimpleVec classes.

Also...

Look into merging Item and ItemF classes. If this works, look into merging the SimpleVec and SimpleVecF classes.

As above for Box and BoxF.
